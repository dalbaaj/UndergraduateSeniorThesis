# Undergraduate Senior Thesis
This repository contains the work behind an independent undergraduate senior thesis which proposed a hybrid risk prediction model based on an evolutionary computation feature selection and ensemble learning method given little literature exists regarding the use of evolutionary computation methods in creating a type 2 diabetes prediction model. 

In the proposed model, a genetic algorithm is wrapped with an extreme gradient-boosting (XGBoost) classifier for optimal feature selection before being passed into an XGBoost classifier. The proposed model was tested on the UCI Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) and then evaluated by comparing the results of the various performance metrics against previous models that had used the data set.
